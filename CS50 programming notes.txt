type in ls. Put a space. Paste the address of the folder.
ls C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\code
press enter to execute it.

ls stands for 'list files' - lists all of the files in that folder.

type in cd. Put a space. Paste the address of the folder.
cd C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\code
press enter to execute it.

cd stands for 'change directory' - cd brings up the address of the folder file.

How to view the full name of the file:
Go to 'code' folder.
Click 'view' at the top of the screen
Then show > file name extensions.
C files end with '.c' - NOT .txt, .doc, etc.

Open a '.c' file by right clicking it and choosing 'open with' > VS Code


Each statement ends with a semicolon.

Make sure Cygwin is in the same folder as the code (Click 'copy address' of the file you want to use)

To compile the code, use command 'gcc' put a space and then paste name of your 'c' file.
gcc hello.c

Once you've used the gcc command, you will get a '.exe' program in the same folder as your '.c' file.

To run your '.exe' program, type:
./'name of exe program'
./a.exe
Then press enter to execute

To give a '.exe' programme a different name than 'a.exe':
Type this into Cygwin:
gcc hello.c -o hello (example) - 
"gcc filename.c -o newname"
Press enter to execute

gcc creates a .exe computer program using your C file
./ executes the .exe programme could do whatever you programmed it to do in your C file.

Save code from VS Code before putting it into Cygwin - Ctrl S is ok. If you see the white dot on your tab, it is NOT saved.

You MUST have files that you need on your computer (e.g. .h files) or your code will not work and the computer will not be able to execute it.
